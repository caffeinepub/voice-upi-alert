  "summary": "Most core frontend requirements (home UI with totals + last 5, voice toggle + TTS + test button, manual paste/parse credit-only, permission explanation gate with persisted acknowledgment, Buy Me a Coffee UPI intent, dark mode + large typography + non-blue/purple theme) appear implemented. However, the required image assets are only referenced, not shown as added in the diff. The diff also introduces Internet Identity/auth and actor hooks that were not requested.",
